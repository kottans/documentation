## Students' achievements

Students' achievements badges may be granted by course mentors
to course students denoting students' valuable achievements.

As Kottans courses provide for tests phase (pre-course, self study phase)
a collection of badges may help to catch student's skills at a glance
at admission interviews phase.

Any Kottans badge is a valuable asset, obtaining it is a privilege
and granting one is an act of responsibility. Therefore a commit
adding the badge must be authored by Kottans organization member
and commit message should follow certain template to enable quick search.

The above allows anyone to validate badges and also
allows Kottans organization to effectively request
illegitimate users to remove badges from publications.

### Granting ceremony

A recognition note from mentor to a student may look as follows

> Hey! You did a great job worth special recognition.
>
> Here is your achievement badge:
> [![Kottans-Student-Git-revert](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3D(%5E.%5E)%3D-mastered%20git%20revert-orange.svg)](https://github.com/kottans/kottans/blob/master/endorsements.md)
>
> Please, provide me with a link to a document in your repo so I could
> PR the badge code into.
>
> Congratulations on the skills level-up!

Code for the above:
```
Hey! You did a great job worth special recognition.

Here is your achievement badge:
[![Kottans-Student-Git-revert](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3D(%5E.%5E)%3D-mastered%20git%20revert-orange.svg)](https://github.com/kottans/kottans/blob/master/endorsements.md)

Please, provide me with a link to a document in your repo so I could
PR the badge code into.

Congratulations on the skills level-up!
```

Use the text above as a reference guide.

Once the link is available the Kottan adds the badge code via PR.
Commit message MUST say
`Add Kottans badge "badge-label" (Kottan's-github-username)`.
Following the template makes the commit searchable.

For validation purposes the Kottan also adds a record to
[kottans/kottans/endorsements.md](https://github.com/kottans/kottans/blob/master/endorsements.md).
